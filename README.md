# Weather-Dashboard
Created a weather dashboard with server API.

## Description

In this weeks challenege, I created a weather dashboard where you can view the forecast of a chosen city. This project displays the current and future forecasts using a 5 day 3 hour interval weather data and shows the temperature, wind spped and humidity of the city. Finally, each searched city is made into a button and saved into local storage so that it can be accessed again for future use.

## Installation

No steps required to install project.

## Usage

First type a city into the search bar and you will see the current weather sata appear alongside the city name where below it you will see the future weather data in 3 hour intervals. Finally your chosen city should be saved as a button where when pressed, the data will display again.
